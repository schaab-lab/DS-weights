## Overview
This repository provides pedagogical user guides and a toolbox to compute welfare assessments using Dynamic Stochastic weights, or DS-weights for short. 

We illustrate the power and applicability of our new approach to welfare analysis across several applications, for which we provide pedagogical code and tutorials. These can be found under ``local_repo_path/applications/``. Examples include:
- 01: social transfer policy in an endowment economy
